# Student Performance Dashboard

This project is part of Capstone project at Algoritma Academy for Data Visualization Specialization. In this project, we are going to use **shiny** to make an interactive dashboard. **Shiny** is a package from R language that can be used to build interactive web apps directly from R.

We are going to use Student Performance data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams), which consists of the Marks secured by the high school students from the United States in various subjects.
